There are 4 files inside the csvs folder:
- useravailability.csv contains records of when a Task was Opened and by who
- users.csv contains a list of users for the system
- taskhistories.csv contains the task ID and which action, when and by who
- openCambridgeTime.csv contains when and who has entered the page
- gcp.json contains the "Auto" assignment of tasks

Naming conventions
- Task and C&L-Task are the same thing
  - Task's naming convention is prefix "Task-" with numbers after
- for MC Status:
  - PME with action AS means the task has been assigned to a user
  - PME with status RP means the task has been assigned back to a user
  - PME with status RR means the task has been assigned to a third party and away from the user
  - PME with status PL means the task has been assigned to a third party and away from the user
  - PMA with action IN means the task has been created
  - PCA with action SC means the task has been completed by the user

If you have a look at gcp.json, the textPayload will contain assignment of task and email. A timestamp is also there in the json file.

The problem that I have is that Productive Time is missing for some entries in useravailability. And I would like to try and populate the numbers back.

Productive Time is the number of minutes between a task being opened by the user to the time the task has been completed by the user.

In Addition, I would like to have a new field called "Waiting Time", which is the number of minutes a task has been created and the task being assigned.

Another field to be created is called "Mode". Mode has 3 values:
- "Unknown"
- "Manual" is when the task does not exists in useravailability.csv
- "Auto" is when the task exists in useravailability.csv

Please see if you can use Javascript to help generate a report like this.

The report should output a csv file with "Task","User","Productive Time","Waiting Time","Mode"
